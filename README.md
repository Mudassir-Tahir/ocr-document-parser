🔍 Smart OCR Document Parser – Invoice, Receipt & Bank Statement Extractor
🛠️ Project Summary:
I developed a smart OCR-powered document parser that extracts structured data from Invoices, Receipts, and Bank Statements using advanced text recognition, document classification, and intelligent parsing logic.
This tool supports PDFs and images (.pdf, .jpg, .png) and converts them into clean, downloadable JSON output – ideal for accounting, bookkeeping, ERP integration, or data automation pipelines.

🔑 Key Features:
✅ File Upload (PDF/Image)
✅ OCR Text Extraction using Tesseract
✅ Document Type Detection (Invoice, Receipt, Bank Statement)
✅ Header Fields Extraction (e.g., Invoice Number, Date, Total, Tax, ICE, etc.)
✅ Transaction Line Parsing with layout-aware logic
✅ Structured JSON Output based on document type
✅ Downloadable JSON for automation or API use
✅ Error Handling + Logging
✅ User-Friendly Web UI (Built with Streamlit)
